# conan-glm
Conan (https://conan.io) package for C++ library GLM (https://github.com/g-truc/glm)

# Version Number Schema

I'm trying to match the number of GLM, plus an extra number seperated by a dash
which represents any changes to the package I've had to make (b/c in theory
there may be multiple packages for each official release of GLM).

# Credit

Nearly all of this was stolen from Memsharded's spdlog Conan file, but please
note that all mistakes and imperfections from the duplication are copyrighted
by me.

example.cpp, used to test the Conan package, is blatantly stolen from the GLM
repo (see here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/g-truc/glm/master/test/core/core_type_mat4x4.cpp)


I have no relation to the GLM library authors.
