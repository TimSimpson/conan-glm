Conan (https://conan.io) package for C++ library GLM (https://github.com/g-truc/glm)

Nearly all of this was stolen from Memsharded's spdlog Conan file, but please
note that all mistakes and imperfections from the duplication are copyrighted
by me.

example.cpp, used to test the Conan package, is blatantly stolen from the GLM
repo (see here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/g-truc/glm/master/test/core/core_type_mat4x4.cpp)


I have no relation to the GLM library authors.
